## Introduction

**Imposters Web** is our final project for [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), developed collaboratively by our team, *The Imposters*.

The project reflects not only the technical concepts we learned during CS50 but also our ability to work together as a team and apply problem-solving skills in a real-world context. Over the course of the semester, we covered fundamental topics such as algorithms, data structures, abstraction, memory, and recursion. Later, we dove into languages like C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each of which shaped our ability to think computationally and translate ideas into functioning software.

When brainstorming for our final project, we wanted something that would combine **utility**, **creativity**, and **entertainment** while also being a reflection of our teamwork. After several discussions, we settled on creating **Imposters Web**, a web-based platform that brings together interactive tools, fun mini-games, and meaningful features. This web app is not just another single-purpose site but rather a collection of different functionalities tied together into one consistent experience.

## Features

Imposters Web includes a diverse set of features, each designed to highlight the skills we developed in CS50. Some of the main features are:

1. **A dedicated button highlighting support for Gaza**
   We felt it was important for our project to carry a message beyond just code and games. The Gaza support button is a small yet meaningful feature that spreads awareness and shows solidarity. Clicking on the button provides a direct, visual reminder of the importance of empathy and global awareness, even in technical projects.

2. **SQL Database Integration**
   The project makes use of an SQL database for storing and managing user data. This gave us a chance to practice designing tables, running queries, and managing persistent data.

3. **Audio Editing Tool**
   Users can upload audio files in different formats and adjust the volume up or down. The edited file can then be downloaded in the same or another supported format. This feature provides practical utility and demonstrates file handling in Python.

4. **Cipher Tool**
   Users can input text and select whether they want to **encrypt** or **decrypt** it. A numeric key is required, and depending on the input, the tool shifts characters forward or backward. This replicates classical ciphers like Caesar and is directly inspired by CS50’s problem sets.

5. **Interactive Games**
   We included two browser-based mini-games. These are simple but engaging, designed with logic and user interaction in mind. They serve both as entertainment and as an example of front-end and back-end integration.

6. **Informational Sections: About Us, Portfolio, and Contact**
   Static pages provide background about the team, showcase the project, and offer a way for users to reach out.

## Technologies Used

We utilized a range of technologies to bring this project to life:

- **Python**: The backbone of the web app, handling server-side logic.
- **Flask**: Web framework for routing and connecting the back-end with HTML templates.
- **Jinja**: For template rendering and embedding dynamic content into HTML.
- **SQL**: For managing persistent data.
- **CSS**: To style and design the user interface.
- **Java**: Used in one of the games for extra interactivity.
